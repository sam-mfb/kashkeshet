//! `kkt setup`: what this machine is set up as (a server run as a service, a
//! server in Docker, or a client of a server elsewhere), the record that
//! says so, and what follows from it: whether `kkt serve` may run here.
//!
//! Like `settings/`, this part reads no files and runs nothing itself. The
//! caller reads and writes the record's text, and answers questions through
//! [`Ask`], so every rule here is tested directly.
