//! Notifications of what happens: new messages, new agents, channels and
//! channel members, and agents and channels hidden.
//!
//! When a message is stored, the sender publishes it here, and the rules do
//! the same when an agent registers, unregisters or is hidden, a channel is
//! created or hidden, or an agent joins or leaves one. The web page and any agent waiting for messages subscribe; waiting
//! agents look only at messages. A subscriber that falls behind is told it
//! missed some and can fetch them from the database.
//!
//! Tokio's broadcast channel does the work, but stays inside this module.
