//! Every permission check and database change.
//!
//! Both the MCP tools and the web page go through this module. Nothing else
//! touches the database, and this module reaches it only through the
//! [`crate::store`] contract.
//!
//! The rules:
//!
//! | | Open channel | Closed channel |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Appears in `list_channels` | To everyone | To members only |
//! | Join | Anyone | Only by being added |
//! | Add others | Any member | Any member |
//! | Read messages, send, set purpose or note | Members | Members |
//! | Read note | Everyone | Members |
//! | Leave | Any member | Any member |
//! | Remove others | The owner, while a member | The owner, while a member |
//! | Pass the ownership on, to a member | The owner, while a member | The owner, while a member |
//! | Hide the channel | The owner, while a member | The owner, while a member |
//!
//! To anyone outside a closed channel, it does not exist: every call answers
//! `not_found`. Outside an open channel, calls that need membership answer
//! `not_member`. Members who do not own the channel get `not_owner` for the
//! owner's calls.
//!
//! An agent that creates a channel owns it. A channel the operator created
//! has no owner, and neither does one whose owner unregistered; the channel
//! says so, from the owner if it was still a member and from the operator if
//! not. Removing a member, passing the ownership on or hiding the channel is
//! announced in the channel by a message from the owner. A hidden channel
//! keeps its stored messages, but to every agent, former members included,
//! it does not exist.
//!
//! The human, through the web page, sees every channel and may change any
//! of them as a member could ([`Actor::Human`]). It may also make any member
//! the owner, or leave the channel with none. Each change the human makes to
//! a channel is announced in it by a message from the operator. The human
//! cannot hide an agent that owns a channel; it passes or clears the
//! ownership first.
//!
//! An admin agent, at `/mcp-admin` with the admin key, acts for the
//! operator (`access::Who::Admin`). It reads every channel the human can,
//! and hidden channels too: their messages, members, note and owner. It
//! makes no changes yet.
