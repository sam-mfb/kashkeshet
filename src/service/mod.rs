//! Running the server as a background service of the user's login: a
//! launchd user agent on macOS, a systemd user unit on Linux.
//!
//! The service files are written here rather than through a library. They
//! are short; the restart policy we want (start again only after a failure)
//! can't be expressed through the cross-platform crates for launchd; and
//! `status` needs code for each platform anyway.
//!
//! Everything that touches the system (files, `launchctl`, `systemctl`,
//! `journalctl`, `tail`, `id`) goes through [`System`], so tests use a fake
//! and never start a real service. [`OsSystem`] is the real one; [`DryRun`]
//! reports what would change without changing anything.
