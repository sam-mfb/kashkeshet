//! kkt in Docker: the Compose files that come with this program, the folder
//! kkt manages for them, and the commands that set it up, start it, back it
//! up, upgrade it and remove it. All of it goes through [`Host`], so it is
//! tested against a fake host.
//!
//! This part only runs Docker. It does not decide what a person wants (the
//! setup answers) or remember what was set up (the setup record); the caller
//! passes those in.
