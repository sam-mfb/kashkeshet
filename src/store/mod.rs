//! Storage: what the rules can ask of the database and change in it.
//!
//! The contract is two traits. [`Reads`] answers questions; [`Writes`] adds
//! the changes. Neither decides anything about permissions: the rules ask, for
//! example, whether an agent is a member, and decide what that means.
//!
//! [`Db`] is the one implementation, over SQLite. Each call to [`Db::read`] or
//! [`Db::write`] runs one closure, and a write closure is one transaction: its
//! changes all commit together, or not at all.
