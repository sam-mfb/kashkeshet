# Refactor plan

This plan turns the code on `next` into the proposed crate map. The map's
proposal (`proposed.json`, shown on the page) and `decisions.md` say what the
code should become. `principles/` and `CLAUDE.md` bind every step. The plan
says in what order to get there, in steps small enough to review.

Every step is one pull request into the `refactor` branch, cut from `next`
at a350e48. Each leaves the whole workspace building and every test passing.
Sam approves `refactor` into `next` as a whole at the end.

The plan has five parts: the rules every step follows; how progress is
measured; how parallel work avoids collisions; the steps; and what needs
Sam, each with the default we proceed on.

## Rules for every step

- **The full checks pass:** `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D
  warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `.github/scripts/check-crates.sh`. CI
  runs them on the pull request (step 0.1 makes CI run on pull requests into
  `refactor`).
- **Existing installs keep working** (CLAUDE.md, design principle 3). No step
  intends to change behaviour. The setup record, the Docker folder, service
  files, keys and key files, the database, client configs, CLI commands and
  flags, and the MCP tools stay exactly as they are. Every pull request says
  so and how it checked. A step that finds it cannot avoid an effect on an
  install stops, and the question goes to Sam (see "What needs Sam").
- **What agents see does not change.** `tests/contract/` stays as it is: no
  step runs `UPDATE_CONTRACT=1`. Every text a user or agent reads (refusals,
  command output, log lines) stays the same unless the step says why.
- **A new crate comes with its paperwork:** its entry in the workspace
  `members` and `default-members`, its row in CLAUDE.md's crate table, its
  entry in `docs/architecture/concerns.json` (layer, kind, concern, what it
  must not do; `generate.py` stops without one), and its crate doc saying what
  it owns.
- **A moved item takes its tests with it.** Tests move with the code they
  test; none is deleted to make a step pass.
- **No compatibility re-exports across steps.** A step that moves an item
  updates every user in the same pull request, so no step leaves a re-export
  for a later one to remove.
- **Each pull request reports the scorecard** before and after (next section).

## Measuring progress

The proposal is frozen at the map it was made from (`map-data.js` at
27f1d11, and `proposed-data.js`). Regenerating `map-data.js` during the
refactor would break `propose.py`, which applies the proposal to that map. So
both files stay as they are until the last step, and the page keeps showing
the plan.

Step 0.2 adds `progress.py`. It runs `generate.py` with a new `--out` option,
which writes the current map built from the code to `target/tmp` instead of
`map-data.js`, and compares it with the frozen proposed map. It prints a
scorecard:

- **Crates:** proposed crates that exist, proposed crates still missing, and
  crates that exist but the proposal removes.
- **Items:** the proposed map's public items found in their proposed crate,
  out of all of them. Items are matched by crate and path. Renamed items use
  their proposed path.
- **Arrows:** the proposed normal arrows present, missing, and extra (arrows
  in the code that the proposal does not have).
- **Kinds and rules:** kinds.py's checks with the proposed kinds, and the
  proposal's own rules (only programs and compositions depend on effect
  crates; no implementation of a contract another crate declares for itself),
  run on the code.

A step is done when every crate, item and arrow it names matches the
proposal, and it adds no new extra arrow or rule break. The scorecard should
only ever move toward the proposal. The last step reaches all items, all
crates and no extra arrows, or lists each remaining difference with its
reason.

## Working in parallel

Several builders can work at once, each in its own clone and on its own
branch off `refactor`. Steps marked **parallel** in the same phase touch
disjoint crate source folders. They still meet in a few shared files, which
are not real conflicts but need a rebase before merging:

- the root `Cargo.toml` (workspace members and dependencies) and `Cargo.lock`
  (regenerate it with `cargo build` after the rebase);
- CLAUDE.md's crate table and `docs/architecture/concerns.json` (different
  rows);
- the programs' wiring in `src/commands/serve.rs`,
  `programs/kkt-keymode/src/main.rs` and `programs/kkt-fake-product/`, where
  several steps each change a few lines.

Steps marked **sequential** depend on an earlier step, or change code that
many others also change, and should not run beside the steps named.

Sizes are rough lines changed: S under 300, M 300 to 1,500, L over 1,500. An
L step is split where the plan says so; a builder who finds a step bigger
than its size should split it again and say so on its pull request.

## The steps

### Phase 0: set up

**0.1 CI runs on pull requests into `refactor`.** S. CI's workflow names only
`next` and `main` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, lines 5 and 7), so today a pull
request into `refactor` runs nothing. Add `refactor` to both lists. Nothing
else in CI names a branch except the crate-map job, which runs only into
`main`. Depends on nothing. Done when CI runs on a pull request into
`refactor`. This change is in the plan's own pull request, so the plan's pull
request is the first to run CI.

**0.2 The scorecard.** S. `generate.py --out <file>`, and `progress.py` as
described above, with a line in `docs/architecture/README.md`. It changes no
code. Depends on nothing. Done when `progress.py` prints the baseline, which
the pull request records.

### Phase 1: foundations (parallel)

These are small, low-risk and used widely, so they go first. They touch
different crates, and each can run beside the others.

**1.1 kkt-hash.** S. New logic crate with `sha256`. kkt-admission, kkt-names,
kkt-provenance, kkt-rules and the program (`src/commands/setup/steps.rs`) call
it instead of sha2, which leaves their manifests. Depends on nothing.
Done when sha2 is only in kkt-hash.

**1.2 kkt-clock-system.** M. `SystemClock` and kkt-clock's `real` feature
move to the new effect crate. kkt-clock becomes a contract crate. Users: the
three programs, `src/logging.rs`, kkt-web's tests and `tests/common`. Depends
on nothing. Done when kkt-clock has no `real` feature and the scorecard's
kkt-clock and kkt-clock-system items match.

**1.3 kkt-entropy and kkt-entropy-os.** M. `Entropy` (with `random_chars`
as a provided method), `SeqEntropy` and `SeededEntropy` (behind `testing`)
move from kkt-names to the new contract crate kkt-entropy. `OsEntropy` moves
to kkt-entropy-os. `ALPHABET` becomes private to kkt-rules. kkt-names keeps
the names, as logic. Users: kkt-rules, kkt-admission, kkt-web, kkt-server,
kkt-mcp, kkt-identity, the programs and `tests/common`. Depends on nothing.
Done when kkt-names has no `real` feature and the scorecard's kkt-entropy
items match.

**1.4 kkt-shutdown-os.** S. `StopSignals` and kkt-shutdown's `real` feature
move to the new effect crate. `Shutdown` stays a concrete type (F10). Users:
the programs. Depends on nothing.

**1.5 kkt-server-listen.** S. `listen` and `Listening` move out of
kkt-server's `real` feature into the new effect crate, which may use axum
(decisions.md). Users: the programs and `tests/common`. Depends on nothing.

**1.6 kkt-format becomes kkt-mcp-formatter.** M. A rename of the package and
its users (kkt-mcp, kkt-server, the programs). `NoticeWording` stays for now
and moves in step 5.5. Depends on nothing. Parallel with 1.1 to 1.5 and 1.7
to 1.9. Not beside 5.3, which changes kkt-mcp.

**1.7 kkt-identity-keymode.** S. `KeyMode` and its tests move to the new
logic crate. kkt-identity keeps `Identify`, `Identified` and `Identifying` as
a contract crate, and gains `testing::FixedIdentify` behind a new `testing`
feature (F11). Users: the programs and kkt-mcp's and kkt-server's tests.
Depends on nothing.

**1.8 kkt-search.** M. `words`, `terms`, `excerpt` and `matches` move from
kkt-db to the new logic crate. `Search`, `Hit` and `Excerpt` stay in kkt-db,
and `excerpt` takes its marks and window as arguments. Touches kkt-db,
kkt-db-sqlite and kkt-store. Depends on nothing. Must land before 5.1.

**1.9 kkt-agent-client stops implementing kkt-watch's Server.** S.
kkt-agent-client gets plain methods with its own types; the program's thin
adapter implements `Server` and maps one `Failure` to the other. Touches
kkt-agent-client, kkt-watch's users and `src/commands/watch.rs`. Depends on
nothing.

### Phase 2: operating-system implementations (parallel)

Each step moves one crate's OS implementation into its own `-os` crate, as a
plain type that implements nothing. Its `real` feature goes with it. The
parent crate becomes logic and keeps its contract, and the program adapts the
plain type to that contract. Each is S to M, depends on nothing in phase 1,
and can run beside every other step in this phase and phase 1. They all add
an adapter to the program, in different files of `src/`.

- **2.1** kkt-container-os (`OsHost`, adapted to kkt-container's `Host`).
- **2.2** kkt-service-os (`OsSystem`, adapted to kkt-service's `System`).
  `DryRun` stays in kkt-service, implementing its own trait (F13).
- **2.3** kkt-remote-access-os (`OsHost`, adapted to kkt-remote-access's
  `Host`).
- **2.4** kkt-client-config-os (`OsHost`, adapted to kkt-client-config's
  `Host`).
- **2.5** kkt-diagnostics-os (`OsProber`, adapted to kkt-diagnostics'
  `Prober`). It keeps reqwest for its probes (msg 2170).
- **2.6** kkt-lane-files-os (`OsDisk`, adapted to kkt-lane-files' `Disk`).
- **2.7** kkt-backup-os (`write` and `prune`). kkt-backup keeps the names,
  contents and pruning rules.

Done for each when the parent crate has no `real` feature, and the
scorecard's items and arrows for the pair match.

### Phase 3: configuration and settings (sequential)

**3.1 kkt-config's items go to their owners.** The 164 rows of the page's
kkt-config table (`config-split.json`) say where each item goes and how:
constant, setting, injected or check. This step is split by owner, into four
pull requests that can run in parallel with each other, since each deletes
different items from kkt-config and adds them to different crates:

- **3.1a** storage, rules and events (kkt-rules, kkt-db-sqlite, kkt-events,
  kkt-names): M.
- **3.1b** the web page and admission (kkt-web, kkt-admission, kkt-hosts): M.
- **3.1c** operations (kkt-container, kkt-service, kkt-setup, kkt-backup,
  kkt-logs, kkt-lane-files, kkt-diagnostics, kkt-client-config): M.
- **3.1d** `Limits` split into each crate's own settings struct, which the
  program fills; `MAX_LANE_DESCRIPTION_CHARS` becomes one of kkt-rules'
  settings (F14): M.

Depends on phases 1 and 2 only where an owner crate was split there (for
example, kkt-backup's constants go to kkt-backup, not kkt-backup-os). Not
beside phase 5, which also changes kkt-rules' settings.

**3.2 kkt-config goes.** S. Delete the empty crate and its row in CLAUDE.md,
and fix `.github/scripts/build-outside-crate.sh` if it names it. Depends on
all of 3.1.

**3.3 kkt-config-file and kkt-config-file-os** (F3). M. Parsing the config
file's TOML and editing its text move from kkt-settings to the new logic
crate, with its own `Config` and `ConfigError` and no dependency on
kkt-settings. Reading and writing the config file's and the instructions
file's bytes move from the program into kkt-config-file-os. The program
adapts a parsed file to kkt-settings' `SettingsSource`, and `parse_file` to
kkt-container's new `ConfigReader`. Depends on 3.2.

**3.4 kkt-machine and kkt-machine-os** (F2). M. `Env` and `Platform` move from
kkt-settings to the new contract crate, with `Machine` and a stand-in behind
`testing`. The paths built from `Env` go to their owners: the config folder
and file to kkt-config-file, the key files to kkt-admission, the data folder
and default database to kkt-setup. `OsMachine` in kkt-machine-os reads the
environment, replacing `src/process.rs`'s `process_env`. Depends on 3.3.

**3.5 kkt-settings only combines its sources** (F2). L, split in three, in
order:

- **3.5a** Each crate's own `SettingError`: kkt-admission, kkt-hosts,
  kkt-service and kkt-web-preview's code (still in kkt-web until 6.3).
  kkt-settings' `InvalidSetting` stays its own. M.
- **3.5b** Types and checks to their owners: `AccessKey` and `key_refusal` to
  kkt-admission, `LogLevel`, `LogPolicy` and `check_dependency_log_level` to
  kkt-logs, `check_bind` and `serve_bind` to kkt-hosts. M.
- **3.5c** The program turns kkt-settings' raw values into each crate's
  settings and calls each owner's check, so `check_settings` goes from the
  program and kkt-keymode stops copying it. kkt-provenance records the run's
  settings as text. After this, only the programs depend on kkt-settings. M.

### Phase 4: logging (sequential)

**4.1 kkt-logs and kkt-logs-os** (F7). M. The rollover and pruning rules stay
in kkt-logs, as logic, with the log's settings from 3.5b. `RotatingFile`,
the `real` feature, tracing-subscriber and the program's `src/logging.rs`
(starting the log) move to kkt-logs-os. Depends on 3.5b. Log files and lines
stay exactly as they are.

**4.2 kkt-log** (F5). M. A new contract crate with `Log`, `Level` and
`testing::CapturedLog`. kkt-mcp and kkt-web take a `Log` and stop using
tracing, and kkt-server's `Parts` take it and hand it on. kkt-logs-os's
`TracingLog` implements it, and the programs wire it in. Depends on 4.1. Not
beside 5.3, 5.4 or 6.x, which change the same constructors in kkt-mcp,
kkt-web and kkt-server. The same events must reach the log, with the same
targets, levels and fields.

### Phase 5: data and core (sequential, the largest)

**5.1 kkt-db is a contract only.** L, split in two:

- **5.1a** `Legacy` moves from kkt-db-sqlite to kkt-db, with no backend's
  terms (F15). kkt-db-sqlite keeps reading `user_version`. M.
- **5.1b** `Database` goes: its typed read and write become `BackendExt`'s
  provided methods over `Backend`. `migrate` and `pending` become `Evolve`'s
  provided methods. The query checks become `Schema`'s methods.
  kkt-db-sqlite's `SqlitePlace` implements `Backend` directly. kkt-store and
  the programs follow. L.

Depends on 1.8. Must pass `kkt_db::testing::conformance`, and the 0.10.0
fixture must still migrate.

**5.2 kkt-store merges into kkt-rules.** L. Its queries, decisions and tables
move into kkt-rules, which reaches kkt-db directly. `Reads` and `Writes`, with
their copied records, go. `testing::memory`, `fail_next_write` and
`swarms_stay_apart` become kkt-rules'. The 0.10.0 migration test moves into
kkt-rules' tests. `.github/scripts/build-outside-crate.sh` stops naming
kkt-store. Depends on 5.1. Mostly moving code, about 4,200 lines; review
by checking the move is mechanical (`git diff --color-moved`). The schema's
migrations move unchanged, and none is edited.

**5.3 kkt-api-agent.** L, split in two:

- **5.3a** The 47 record types the proposal moves (agents, channels,
  messages, memory, lanes, errors, `SwarmId`) move from kkt-rules to the new
  contract crate, with the new `Limits` record (F14). Every user follows. L
  in lines but mechanical.
- **5.3b** `Api` and the per-area traits (`Agents`, `Channels`, `Messages`,
  `Memory`, `Lanes`). `Rules` implements them; kkt-mcp's agent endpoint and
  kkt-identity take them instead of `Rules`. M.

Depends on 5.2.

**5.4 kkt-api-operator and kkt-api-admin.** L, split in two:

- **5.4a** kkt-api-operator: `Views`, `Changes`, `Lanes` and `Server`, with
  their records. `Rules` implements them. `Views::overview` takes the
  activity bucket and window as arguments (F4), so kkt-rules stops using
  kkt-web's `WEB_ACTIVITY_*`. M.
- **5.4b** kkt-api-admin: `Admin` and `Swarms`. `Rules` implements them, and
  kkt-mcp's admin endpoint takes them. M.

Depends on 5.3.

**5.5 The default wording** (F9). S. `NoticeWording` moves from
kkt-mcp-formatter into kkt-rules as `DefaultWording`, its own implementation
of its own `OperatorWording`. The programs pass it in, and kkt-server's
wording adapter goes. Depends on 1.6. Can run beside 5.1 and 5.2.

### Phase 6: the web page and the server (sequential)

**6.1 Web sessions move into kkt-web** (msg 2021). M. kkt-admission keeps the
access decision. kkt-web's `Gate` keeps only the two questions for
kkt-admission, and kkt-server's `AdmissionGate` implements it. Depends on
3.1b. Can run beside phase 5.

**6.2 kkt-web uses the kkt-api traits directly.** M to L. `Source` gives way
to `Api`, `RulesSource` and its copied records go, and `PageLimits` holds the
page's own limits. Depends on 5.4 and 6.1.

**6.3 kkt-web-preview and kkt-api-sim** (F8, F16). M. The preview becomes a
program of its own (kkt-web-preview). `Preview` and `PreviewGate` move to the
new test support crate kkt-api-sim, behind `testing`, and answer `limits`
with their own values. kkt-web's and kkt-mcp's tests use the stand-ins
(fixed clock, seeded entropy, a manual stop) instead of the `-os` crates.
`check-crates.sh` must allow the dev-only preview program to turn on
kkt-api-sim's `testing` (see "What needs Sam"). Depends on 6.2.

### Phase 7: the programs do no machine work (F1)

These change the program's commands, so they collide with each other in
`src/`. 7.1 goes first; after it, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5 can run in parallel, and
7.3 runs alone.

**7.1 kkt-terminal-os.** L. `Terminal` (output, errors, whether input and
output are a terminal, reading a line, the closed-pipe default with libc)
and `BrowserLink` move out of the program. kkt-setup gains `Lines` and
`Prompter`, the questions' rules. Every command writes through `Terminal`,
so this step touches every command. Depends on phase 3.

**7.2 kkt-admission-os.** M. Reading and writing the key files moves out of
the program. kkt and kkt-keymode adapt `KeyFiles` to kkt-admission's
`KeyTexts` instead of reading files themselves. Depends on 3.5 and 7.1.

**7.3 kkt-setup-os and setup's decisions.** L, split in two, in order:

- **7.3a** The setup record, its unfinished note, the data folder, the
  program's path and PATH move to kkt-setup-os. Which server and key a client
  uses, and the record's rules, move to kkt-setup. The Docker folder's
  `.env` and the Tailscale auth key file are read through kkt-container's
  `Host`. M.
- **7.3b** Doctor's checks, the status lines, the backup folders, uninstall's
  record and the per-server key file's name move to kkt-setup. M.

Depends on 7.1.

**7.4 Agent credential files.** M. They move to kkt-agent-client, which
reads a file's owner and mode and tightens it. kkt-setup's
`credential_file_check` holds the rule. Watch's state file becomes
kkt-agent-client's `StateFile`, which the program adapts to kkt-watch's
`Place`. Depends on 7.1.

**7.5 The dev programs.** S to M. The fake product's HTTP client moves into
its tests, through kkt-agent-client's `Http`. Its main uses `Terminal` and
`SqlitePlace::create`. kkt-keymode uses the shared key files and checks.
Depends on 7.1 and 7.2.

Done for the phase when kinds.py reports no machine work in any program's
own code.

### Phase 8: finish

**8.1 The map is the code.** M. Regenerate `map-data.js`. Compare it with
the proposal and record any remaining difference in `decisions.md`, with its
reason. Update CLAUDE.md's crate tables to the new layout. Turn the page's
proposed map into the record of the finished refactor, or retire it (Sam's
choice; default below). Depends on everything.

## Order at a glance

```
0.1, 0.2
1.1 … 1.9 and 2.1 … 2.7      all in parallel
3.1a–d (parallel) → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 → 3.5a → 3.5b → 3.5c
4.1 → 4.2                     after 3.5b
1.8 → 5.1a → 5.1b → 5.2 → 5.3a → 5.3b → 5.4a → 5.4b
5.5                           after 1.6, beside 5.1 and 5.2
6.1 (after 3.1b) → 6.2 (after 5.4) → 6.3
7.1 (after phase 3) → 7.2, 7.4, 7.5 in parallel; 7.3a → 7.3b
8.1
```

Three builders can work most of the time: one on phases 1 and 2, one on
phase 3 then 4, and one on phase 5. Phases 6 and 7 follow them.

## What needs Sam

Each has the default we proceed on, so nothing waits.

1. **CI on `refactor`.** The plan's pull request adds `refactor` to CI's
   branch lists. Default: keep it until `refactor` merges into `next`, then
   remove it in the same pull request as step 8.1.
2. **Breaking the shared crates' public surface.** kkt-pro builds on
   kkt-rules, kkt-store and kkt-server by git, and the refactor removes
   kkt-store and changes these crates' contracts. Default: proceed, since the
   proposal is the decision. Each step that changes a shared crate's public
   items adds a line to CHANGELOG.md under the coming release, for crates that
   depend on kkt by git. The outside-crate CI check is kept building.
3. **An unavoidable effect on an existing install.** Default: none is
   expected. A step that finds one stops, posts the question, and leaves the
   rest of the plan going.
4. **The preview program turning on kkt-api-sim's `testing`** (F8).
   `check-crates.sh` rule 3 forbids turning on another package's `testing`
   outside dev-dependencies. Default: step 6.3 lets a dev-only program
   (`[package.metadata.kkt] dev-only = true`) do so, and says so in the
   script's header and in CLAUDE.md.
5. **Log output.** F5 changes how kkt-mcp and kkt-web log. Default: the same
   events, targets, levels and fields reach the log file and the terminal.
6. **How `refactor` merges into `next`.** Default: one pull request, merged
   with a merge commit, no force-push, after a final review of the whole
   diff and a full CI run.
7. **The proposed map after the refactor.** Default: step 8.1 keeps the
   proposal as a record of what was planned, with the scorecard at the end,
   and the page's "Current" map shows the code.
